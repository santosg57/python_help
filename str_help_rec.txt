 |      separator is not found, return two empty strings and S.
 |  
 |  rsplit(...)
 |      S.rsplit([sep [,maxsplit]]) -> list of strings
 |      
 |      Return a list of the words in the string S, using sep as the
 |      delimiter string, starting at the end of the string and working
 |      to the front.  If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are
 |      done. If sep is not specified or is None, any whitespace string

 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S with trailing whitespace removed.
 |      If chars is given and not None, remove characters in chars instead.

 |  
 |  split(...)
 |      S.split([sep [,maxsplit]]) -> list of strings
 |      
 |      Return a list of the words in the string S, using sep as the
 |      delimiter string.  If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit
 |      splits are done. If sep is not specified or is None, any
 |      whitespace string is a separator and empty strings are removed
 |      from the result.
 |  
 |  splitlines(...)
 |      S.splitlines(keepends=False) -> list of strings
 |      
 |      Return a list of the lines in S, breaking at line boundaries.

 |      is given and true.
 |  
 |  startswith(...)
 |      S.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]]) -> bool
 |      
 |      Return True if S starts with the specified prefix, False otherwise.
 |      With optional start, test S beginning at that position.
 |      With optional end, stop comparing S at that position.
 |      prefix can also be a tuple of strings to try.
 |  
 |  strip(...)
 |      S.strip([chars]) -> string or unicode
 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S with leading and trailing
 |      whitespace removed.
 |      If chars is given and not None, remove characters in chars instead.

 |  
 |  swapcase(...)
 |      S.swapcase() -> string
 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S with uppercase characters
 |      converted to lowercase and vice versa.

 |      S.translate(table [,deletechars]) -> string
 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S, where all characters occurring
 |      in the optional argument deletechars are removed, and the
 |      remaining characters have been mapped through the given
 |      translation table, which must be a string of length 256 or None.
 |      If the table argument is None, no translation is applied and
 |      the operation simply removes the characters in deletechars.
 |  
 |  upper(...)
 |      S.upper() -> string
 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S converted to uppercase.
 |  
 |  zfill(...)
 |      S.zfill(width) -> string
 |      
 |      Pad a numeric string S with zeros on the left, to fill a field
 |      of the specified width.  The string S is never truncated.
