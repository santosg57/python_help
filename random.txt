    General notes on the underlying Mersenne Twister core generator:
    
    * The period is 2**19937-1.
    * It is one of the most extensively tested generators in existence.
    * Without a direct way to compute N steps forward, the semantics of
      jumpahead(n) are weakened to simply jump to another distant state and rely
      on the large period to avoid overlapping sequences.
    * The random() method is implemented in C, executes in a single Python step,
      and is, therefore, threadsafe.

    class Random(_random.Random)
     |  Random number generator base class used by bound module functions.
     |  
     |  Used to instantiate instances of Random to get generators that don't
     |  share state.  Especially useful for multi-threaded programs, creating
     |  a different instance of Random for each thread, and using the jumpahead()
     |  method to ensure that the generated sequences seen by each thread don't
     |  overlap.
     |  
     |  Class Random can also be subclassed if you want to use a different basic
     |  generator of your own devising: in that case, override the following
     |  methods: random(), seed(), getstate(), setstate() and jumpahead().
     |  Optionally, implement a getrandbits() method so that randrange() can cover
     |  arbitrarily large ranges.
     |  
     |  Method resolution order:
     |      Random
     |      _random.Random
     |      __builtin__.object
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __getstate__(self)
     |  
     |  __init__(self, x=None)
     |      Initialize an instance.
     |      
     |      Optional argument x controls seeding, as for Random.seed().
     |  
     |  __reduce__(self)
     |  
     |  __setstate__(self, state)
     |  
     |  betavariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Beta distribution.
     |      
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |      Returned values range between 0 and 1.
     |  
     |  choice(self, seq)
     |      Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.
     |  
     |  expovariate(self, lambd)
     |      Exponential distribution.
     |      
     |      lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be
     |      nonzero.  (The parameter would be called "lambda", but that is
     |      a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to
     |      positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative
     |      infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.
     |  
     |  gammavariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Gamma distribution.  Not the gamma function!
     |      
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |      
     |      The probability distribution function is:
     |      
     |                  x ** (alpha - 1) * math.exp(-x / beta)
     |        pdf(x) =  --------------------------------------
     |                    math.gamma(alpha) * beta ** alpha
     |  
     |  gauss(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Gaussian distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.  This is
     |      slightly faster than the normalvariate() function.
     |      
     |      Not thread-safe without a lock around calls.
     |  
     |  getstate(self)
     |      Return internal state; can be passed to setstate() later.
     |  
     |  jumpahead(self, n)
     |      Change the internal state to one that is likely far away
     |      from the current state.  This method will not be in Py3.x,
     |      so it is better to simply reseed.
     |  
     |  lognormvariate(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Log normal distribution.
     |      
     |      If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you'll get a
     |      normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.
     |      mu can have any value, and sigma must be greater than zero.
     |  
     |  normalvariate(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Normal distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.
     |  
     |  paretovariate(self, alpha)
     |      Pareto distribution.  alpha is the shape parameter.
     |  
     |  randint(self, a, b)
     |      Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
     |  
     |  randrange(self, start, stop=None, step=1, _int=<type 'int'>, _maxwidth=9007199254740992L)
     |      Choose a random item from range(start, stop[, step]).
     |      
     |      This fixes the problem with randint() which includes the
     |      endpoint; in Python this is usually not what you want.
     |  
     |  sample(self, population, k)
     |      Chooses k unique random elements from a population sequence.
     |      
     |      Returns a new list containing elements from the population while
     |      leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is
     |      in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random
     |      samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
     |      into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).
     |      
     |      Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the
     |      population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
     |      selection in the sample.
     |      
     |      To choose a sample in a range of integers, use xrange as an argument.
     |      This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a
     |      large population:   sample(xrange(10000000), 60)
     |  
     |  seed(self, a=None)
     |      Initialize internal state from hashable object.
     |      
     |      None or no argument seeds from current time or from an operating
     |      system specific randomness source if available.
     |      
     |      If a is not None or an int or long, hash(a) is used instead.
     |  
     |  setstate(self, state)
     |      Restore internal state from object returned by getstate().
     |  
     |  shuffle(self, x, random=None)
     |      x, random=random.random -> shuffle list x in place; return None.
     |      
     |      Optional arg random is a 0-argument function returning a random
     |      float in [0.0, 1.0); by default, the standard random.random.
     |  
     |  triangular(self, low=0.0, high=1.0, mode=None)
     |      Triangular distribution.
     |      
     |      Continuous distribution bounded by given lower and upper limits,
     |      and having a given mode value in-between.
     |      
     |      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution
     |  
     |  uniform(self, a, b)
     |      Get a random number in the range [a, b) or [a, b] depending on rounding.
     |  
     |  vonmisesvariate(self, mu, kappa)
     |      Circular data distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*pi, and
     |      kappa is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or
     |      equal to zero.  If kappa is equal to zero, this distribution reduces
     |      to a uniform random angle over the range 0 to 2*pi.
     |  
     |  weibullvariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Weibull distribution.
     |      
     |      alpha is the scale parameter and beta is the shape parameter.

     |      Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.
     |

     |      lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be
     |      nonzero.  (The parameter would be called "lambda", but that is

     |      Gaussian distribution.
     |

     |  vonmisesvariate(self, mu, kappa)
     |      Circular data distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*pi, and

     |      Act as if n calls to random() were made, but quickly.
     |      
     |      n is an int, greater than or equal to 0.
     |      
     |      Example use:  If you have 2 threads and know that each will
     |      consume no more than a million random numbers, create two Random
     |      objects r1 and r2, then do
     |          r2.setstate(r1.getstate())

     |      
     |      If a is an int or long, a is used directly.  Distinct values between
     |      0 and 27814431486575L inclusive are guaranteed to yield distinct
     |      internal states (this guarantee is specific to the default

     |  setstate(self, state)
     |      Restore internal state from object returned by getstate().
     |  
     |  whseed(self, a=None)
     |      Seed from hashable object's hash code.

     |      None or no argument seeds from current time.  It is not guaranteed
     |      that objects with distinct hash codes lead to distinct internal
     |      states.
     |      
     |      This is obsolete, provided for compatibility with the seed routine
     |      used prior to Python 2.1.  Use the .seed() method instead.

     |  Methods inherited from Random:
     |  
     |  __getstate__(self)
     |  
     |  __init__(self, x=None)
     |      Initialize an instance.
     |      
     |      Optional argument x controls seeding, as for Random.seed().
     |  
     |  __reduce__(self)
     |  
     |  __setstate__(self, state)
     |  
     |  betavariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Beta distribution.
     |      
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |      Returned values range between 0 and 1.
     |  
     |  choice(self, seq)
     |      Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.
     |  
     |  expovariate(self, lambd)
     |      Exponential distribution.
     |      
     |      lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be
     |      nonzero.  (The parameter would be called "lambda", but that is
     |      a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to
     |      positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative
     |      infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.
     |  
     |  gammavariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Gamma distribution.  Not the gamma function!
     |      
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |      
     |      The probability distribution function is:
     |      
     |                  x ** (alpha - 1) * math.exp(-x / beta)
     |        pdf(x) =  --------------------------------------
     |                    math.gamma(alpha) * beta ** alpha
     |  
     |  gauss(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Gaussian distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.  This is
     |      slightly faster than the normalvariate() function.
     |      
     |      Not thread-safe without a lock around calls.
     |  
     |  lognormvariate(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Log normal distribution.
     |      
     |      If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you'll get a
     |      normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.
     |      mu can have any value, and sigma must be greater than zero.
     |  
     |  normalvariate(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Normal distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.
     |  
     |  paretovariate(self, alpha)
     |      Pareto distribution.  alpha is the shape parameter.
     |  
     |  randint(self, a, b)
     |      Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
     |  
     |  randrange(self, start, stop=None, step=1, _int=<type 'int'>, _maxwidth=9007199254740992L)
     |      Choose a random item from range(start, stop[, step]).
     |      
     |      This fixes the problem with randint() which includes the
     |      endpoint; in Python this is usually not what you want.
     |  
     |  sample(self, population, k)
     |      Chooses k unique random elements from a population sequence.
     |      
     |      Returns a new list containing elements from the population while
     |      leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is
     |      in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random
     |      samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
     |      into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).
     |      
     |      Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the
     |      population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
     |      selection in the sample.
     |      
     |      To choose a sample in a range of integers, use xrange as an argument.
     |      This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a
     |      large population:   sample(xrange(10000000), 60)
     |  
     |  shuffle(self, x, random=None)
     |      x, random=random.random -> shuffle list x in place; return None.
     |      
     |      Optional arg random is a 0-argument function returning a random
     |      float in [0.0, 1.0); by default, the standard random.random.
     |  
     |  triangular(self, low=0.0, high=1.0, mode=None)
     |      Triangular distribution.
     |      
     |      Continuous distribution bounded by given lower and upper limits,
     |      and having a given mode value in-between.
     |      
     |      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution
     |  
     |  uniform(self, a, b)
     |      Get a random number in the range [a, b) or [a, b] depending on rounding.
     |  
     |  vonmisesvariate(self, mu, kappa)
     |      Circular data distribution.
     |      
     |      mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*pi, and
     |      kappa is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or
     |      equal to zero.  If kappa is equal to zero, this distribution reduces
     |      to a uniform random angle over the range 0 to 2*pi.
     |  
     |  weibullvariate(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Weibull distribution.
     |      
     |      alpha is the scale parameter and beta is the shape parameter.
